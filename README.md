# Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Platform

**Deploy and manage Kubernetes applications across AWS, GCP, and Azure with Terraform, Crossplane, Helm, and ArgoCD.**

---

## About the Project

The **Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Platform** is a modular, production-ready framework for deploying and managing Kubernetes workloads across AWS, GCP, and Azure. It combines the power of Terraform, Crossplane, Helm, and ArgoCD to enable:

- **Automated, repeatable cluster provisioning** using Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform/Crossplane) for EKS, GKE, and AKS.
- **GitOps-driven application delivery** with Helm and ArgoCD for consistent, auditable, and self-healing deployments.
- **Multi-cloud load balancing** using ExternalDNS for DNS-based routing and Istio for advanced service mesh capabilities.
- **Disaster recovery** with Velero for backup, restore, and migration of Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes.
- **Cost optimization dashboards** with Kubecost, providing visibility and actionable insights into multi-cloud Kubernetes spend.

The platform is designed for organizations seeking high availability, resilience, and cloud-agnostic operations. All infrastructure and application changes are tracked in Git, making it easy to audit, roll back, and collaborate.

## Complete Description

The Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Platform is a comprehensive, production-ready framework for provisioning, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). It leverages the best open-source tools and practices for:

- **Automated Cluster Provisioning:** Use Terraform modules and Crossplane to declaratively provision and manage Kubernetes clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS) in any cloud. Infrastructure-as-code ensures repeatability and auditability.
- **GitOps Application Delivery:** Deploy applications with Helm charts and manage them using ArgoCD for automated, version-controlled, and self-healing deployments. All app changes are tracked in Git, enabling easy rollbacks and audit trails.
- **Multi-Cloud Load Balancing:** Achieve high availability and geo-redundancy by distributing traffic across clusters in different clouds. Use ExternalDNS for DNS-based load balancing, or Istio service mesh for advanced cross-cluster routing and failover.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Protect your workloads using Velero for backup, restore, and migration of Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. Supports multi-cloud backup storage and cross-cloud restore for rapid disaster recovery.
- **Cost Optimization Dashboards:** Integrate Kubecost to monitor, visualize, and optimize Kubernetes spend across all clusters. Get actionable insights for resource allocation and cost savings.

This platform is modular and extensible‚Äîideal for organizations seeking cloud-agnostic, resilient, and scalable Kubernetes operations.
