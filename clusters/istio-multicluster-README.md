# Multi-Cloud Load Balancing Example: Istio Service Mesh

For advanced multi-cloud load balancing and service discovery, you can deploy [Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/) in multi-primary mode across clusters on AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## Steps
1. Deploy Istio in each cluster (multi-primary setup).
2. Enable endpoint discovery and cross-cluster load balancing.
3. Use Istio IngressGateway for global entry points.
4. Configure DNS to point to all IngressGateway IPs for round-robin or geo-based routing.
